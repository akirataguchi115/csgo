# Manual
## Register
To use most of the function on the application the user must register to the site. This can be done from the upper right corner. The registering page will ask you the following: New username, New Password, Name and Student number. Both username's and password's length must be between 3 and 40 characters. The student number on the other hand should follow the following pattern: 0xxx xxx xxx where there are no spaces and x's are form a unique number. The application will warn the you if the requirements on the data are not correct.
## Login
Just like the registering Logging in can be done from the upper right corner. Due to accessibility reasons autofocus is on the username field so the user doesn't have to click it every time he/she logs in.
## Adding courses and prequisite courses
The admin must add the courses and prequisite courses manually via SQL(see [database architecture](https://github.com/akirataguchi115/csgo/blob/master/documentation/architecture.md)).
## Scheduling courses
While logged in the user can schedule their courses. Click the _Schedule a Course_ -button from navigation bar. Select the course you wish to schedule from the dropdown menu. Insert the scheduled/received grade that is between 1 and 5. Insert the course starting date and completion date in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (these are required for the application to tell you if the schedule is chronologically correct). Once you're finished click the _Schedule a course_ -button. You will be redirected to the listing of your schedule. An example of filling the forms: ![schedule_example](https://github.com/akirataguchi115/csgo/blob/master/documentation/schedule_example.png)
## Listing all scheduled courses
Click the _Show all Courses_ -button from the navigation bar. This page shows all the currently scheduled courses from the currently logged in user. The same submitted information are there that the user once submitted through the _Schedule a Course_ page. The _Do the prequisites meet?_ column is new but we'll get to that in a bit. _Lower the expected grade by 1_ does what it's described to do. This way the student can easily loewr the scheduled grade by one without having to delete the schedulement completely. _Remove scheduled course_ removes the schedulement completely from the student. The deleted course can then be added again through the _Schedule a Course_ -button. Below the Courses there is a paragraph telling the student the amount of scheduled courses and the average grade of the scheduled courses. The _Do the prequisites meet?_ column tells **if an advanced course's prequisite course's completion date is later than the advanced course's starting date**; simply put: Student cannot attend an advanced course if the student hasn't completed the basic ones yet! An example where the advanced course(_Ohjelmoinnin jatkokurssi_) in programming is scheduled before a basic(_Ohjelmoinnin perusteet_) course in programming: ![list_example](https://github.com/akirataguchi115/csgo/blob/master/documentation/list_example.png)
## Editing user information
To edit user information click the _Edit user information_ button under Logout -button. In this page the user logged in can change their password by first providing the old password. The user's displayed name can also be changed. When finished press the _Update_ button to update all the provided information. If unsuccesful(e.g. old password doesn't match) the same page will be redisplayed to you. If you want to permanently delete your account from the application click the _Delete student account permanently_ -button. This will remove all your scheduled courses, log you out and take you back to the login screen.
## Loggin out
To log out click the blue _Logout_ -button from the navigation bar. The login screen will then be displayed to you.
