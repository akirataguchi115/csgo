# How to install
## Cloning the repo
`git clone` the repository to your desired directory [like so](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 
## Installing the `python` requirements
Install all the Python-project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`(python and pip must also be installed).
## Running locally
In the root of the project run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the development environment. Run `python run.py`. The application is now running in f.ex. `localhost:5000` depending on the PC's configurations in the web browser like so:
