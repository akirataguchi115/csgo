# What's left out / What shouldn't be left out
## Further development
* Heavier use of the ORM would have lifted the abstraction level of the project a to a nicer degree although maybe pure SQL gives the flexibility in an event of changin the ORM provider.
* Bigger font, minimized span of the content etc. would have made the application more accessible especially when there not enough content usually to provide a full HD screen with it.
## Deficiencies
* Better GUI would make the scheduling easier visually for the user (e.g. graphical drop down of a calendar while deciding starting and completion dates) which was the point of the application in the first place: easier course scheduling.
