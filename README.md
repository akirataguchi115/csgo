# Course Scheduler: Graduating On-time
`csgo` is course Scheduler that allows the student to plan one's courses in the way that the soft(or hard) prequisites are met. This way the student can attend courses that are in *topological* order. E.g. If a student schedules themselves a _Database application training project_ with the course _Basics of databases_ that has a completion date later than of the _Database application training project_'s starting date.
The application is live [here](https://csgoplanner.herokuapp.com/). One can test the application from within the Heroku by first registering in the application.
